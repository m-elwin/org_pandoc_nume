* Overview
This directory consists of my template for creating and publishing web pages from org mode.

To use, clone this repository.  Write org files.
Create a Makefile based on the template Makefile in this repository specifying
the files to publish, the remote path to publish, and the path to this repository.

Then =make= will generate the html files in an html directory and =make publish= will
publish them to a remote server.
